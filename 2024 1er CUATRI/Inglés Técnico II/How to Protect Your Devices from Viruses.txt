Next, you need to Be Wary of Downloads. You will only download software and files from trusted sources, avoiding suspicious websites.
Also, you have to keep your Software Updated. Update your operating system and applications whenever updates are available. Updates often include security patches.
Strong passwords must be used. Unique and complex passwords should be created for all accounts. You should avoid using the same password for multiple acounts.
Its important to Enable Firewalls because they help filter incoming and outgoing traffic on your device, adding a layer of protection.
